# ALX Front-End JavaScript Project

## Project Description

This project serves as a hands-on exploration of advanced front-end development concepts, focusing on **TypeScript** and **Webpack**. It demonstrates how to set up a modern development environment, manage dependencies, and apply type-safe programming principles to a JavaScript codebase.

The project is structured into various tasks, each addressing a specific skill, from basic TypeScript compilation to more complex module resolution and type declarations for JavaScript libraries

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine.

- Node.js: [Download from nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm: Included with Node.js

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-front-end-javascript.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd alx-front-end-javascript
```

Install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Project Structure

The project is organized to be clear and easy to navigate:

- `package.json`: Contains project metadata and a list of all dependencies.
- `webpack.config.js`: The Webpack configuration file for building the project.
- `tsconfig.json`: The TypeScript configuration file.
- `./js/`: The main directory for all JavaScript and TypeScript source code.

## Key Features

- **TypeScript Integration**: The project uses TypeScript for static type checking, improving code quality and maintainability.
- **Webpack Bundling**: Webpack is used to bundle all project assets (JavaScript, CSS, etc.) into a single file for production.
- **Type Declaration Files (.d.ts)**: Demonstrates how to write declaration files to add type information to existing JavaScript code.
